> This is a beta version of the [Solana Toolkit](/docs/toolkit/), and is still a
> WIP. Please post all feedback as a GitHub issue
> [here](https://github.com/solana-foundation/mucho/issues/new?title=%5Btoolkit%5D%20).

> The Trident fuzz tester is still a WIP and currently only Anchor compatible
> may require some manual work to complete tests.

## Initialize Fuzz Tests

Navigate to an Anchor based workspace and run:

```shell
trident init
```

This command does the following:

- Builds the Anchor-based project.
- Reads the generated IDL.
- Based on the IDL creates the fuzzing template.


## Write Fuzz Tests

For projects without custom PDA seeds, Trident automatically generates a complete working fuzz test. Remove functions containing `todo!` macros from the generated fuzz test and you can proceed directly to the [Execute Fuzz Tests](#execute-fuzz-tests) section.

### Instruction Accounts

Define account properties using intuitive macro constraints:

```rust
pub struct InitializeFnInstructionAccounts {
    #[account(mut,signer,storage = author)]
    pub author: TridentAccount,
    #[account(
        mut,
        storage = hello_world_account,
        seeds = [b"hello_world_seed"],
    )]
    pub hello_world_account: TridentAccount,
    #[account(address = "11111111111111111111111111111111", skip_snapshot)]
    pub system_program: TridentAccount,
}
```

For programs with complex seed structures, you'll need to configure accounts manually through the `set_accounts` function.

Refer to [detailed documentation](https://ackee.xyz/trident/docs/latest/start-fuzzing/writting-fuzz-test/instruction-accounts/#instruction-accounts) for advanced configurations.

### Instruction Data

Trident automatically handles data generation for primitive types (`u64`, `bool`, etc.). For custom data types or manual data specification, utilize the `set_data` function. 

Learn more in [instruction data guide](https://ackee.xyz/trident/docs/latest/start-fuzzing/writting-fuzz-test/instruction-data/).

## Customize Fuzz Tests

Enhance your fuzzing strategy with Trident's advanced features:

- [Fuzzing flows](https://ackee.xyz/trident/docs/latest/trident-advanced/trident-transactions/trident-fuzzing-flows/): Control the order of transaction execution. This feature lets you test specific sequences of instructions, ensuring your program handles state transitions correctly.

- [Invariant checks](https://ackee.xyz/trident/docs/latest/trident-advanced/trident-transactions/transaction-hooks/invariant-check/): Add validation functions that run after each successful transaction. Use these to verify your program maintains correct state throughout the test execution.

- [Transaction hooks](https://ackee.xyz/trident/docs/latest/trident-advanced/trident-transactions/transaction-hooks/pre-post-execution/): Insert custom logic before and after each transaction. This enables setup of preconditions and verification of post-conditions for each test case.

See [advanced documentation](https://ackee.xyz/trident/docs/latest/trident-advanced/) for additional features and examples.

## Execute Fuzz Tests

From your `trident-tests` directory, launch the fuzzer:

```shell
# Replace <TARGET_NAME> with the name of the
# fuzz test (for example: "fuzz_0")
trident fuzz run-afl <TARGET_NAME>
```

## Debug Fuzz Tests

When issues are detected, analyze them with the debugging tool:

```shell
# fuzzer will run the <TARGET_NAME> with the specified <CRASH_FILE_PATH>
trident fuzz debug-afl <TARGET_NAME> <CRASH_FILE_PATH>
```

For comprehensive guidance, consult [documentation](https://ackee.xyz/trident/docs/latest/) or use the `--help` flag.
